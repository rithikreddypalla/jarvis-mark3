12/10/2023-trainer and haarcascade added to repo ,trainer file is empty the trained data got deleted in the wipeout which caused the fallback
-we cannot again use the openai approach, it had limits, only around 400 tokens can be sent including the saved conversation in the .doc file locally
-Bard(google experiment) says i should use an NLP(natural language procesor) such as SpaCy, Spacy is being updated and bard is being added to it, i can either wait for it to be added or try something in Azure
